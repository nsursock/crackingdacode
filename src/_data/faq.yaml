  - question: Were you really a European secret agent in the past?
    answer: Yes, I was. I participated in the War on Terror since 2001 and infiltrated Ben Laden's network until 2011 when I called it quits.
  - question: Why do you call yourself a modern Donnie Brasco?
    answer: That's because my mission was successful but the government never paid me. They owe me 25 million dollars. I had to rely on my savings and my skills as a webdev and a musician.
  - question: Is blogging your only occupation?
    answer: No, of course not. I'm writing a novel about my experience that should be out in 6 months if everything goes well. I also love music and was contacted by a record label to produce some of my tracks.
