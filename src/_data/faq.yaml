  - question: Why do you call yourself a modern Donnie Brasco?
    answer: I participated in the War on Terror since 2001 and infiltrated Ben Laden's network until 2011 when I called it quits. My mission was successful but the government never paid me. They owe me 25 million dollars. Today I'm completely broke and decided to diversify.
  - question: Is blogging your only occupation?
    answer: No, of course not. I'm writing a novel about my experience that should be out in 6 months if everything goes well. I also love music and was contacted by a record label to produce some of my tracks.
  - question: Why can't I comment on your posts?
    answer: The comment system will soon be available. Please wait a few months. In the meantime, you can send me a message through the contact page.
  - question: How do I leave a testimonial?
    answer: On the contact page, use the subject field and specify Testimonial. Testimonials will be featured randomly around the website. After receiving your message, you might be asked for a picture to display next to the testimonial.
