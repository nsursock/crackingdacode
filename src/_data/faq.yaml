  - question: Why are you rooting for world peace?
    answer: I was born in Beirut (1980) during the Civil War. My parents left for Paris in 1983 because I couldn't sleep anymore. I suffered deeply from war and its consequences. That's why I would like to imagine a world without it. Competition, yes. War, no thanks.
  - question: Is blogging your only occupation?
    answer: No, of course not. I'm writing a novel about my experience that should be out in 6 months if everything goes well. I also love music and was contacted by a record label to produce some of my tracks.
  - question: Why can't I comment on your posts?
    answer: The comment system will soon be available. Please wait a few months. In the meantime, you can send me a message through the contact page.
